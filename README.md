# TCADAS-tool
TCADAS tool is designed to virtual fabricate the semiconductor device. The tool fabricates and simulates the conventional FGMOS 65 nm in the default setup.
The Main Python source code was used to design the TCADAS tool successfully, which is named: "Main_Code_Python_TCAD_App_V12.py". The users who applied this code to investigate the semiconductor device must change the correct directory path in the source file: "Main_Code_Python_TCAD_App_V12.py".
